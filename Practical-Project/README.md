- Struggled with the code on the SVG animation couldn't get it to move
therefore used Margin-top: xxx
- Wasn't able to remove the errors from the javascript for the google Maps API.
- I have got errors within the CSS which I simply cannot remove, have researched the
issue and a lot of posts on treehouse community say that the code has not been implemented within
the validator.

-Used the following to beautify and validate the HTML and CSS and Javascript

<img src="img/screenshot5.png" alt = logo>
<img src="img/screenshot6.png" alt = logo>
<img src="img/screenshot7.png" alt = logo>

- Ran the CSS through the beautifier and copied and pasted the code within.
